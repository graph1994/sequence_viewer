# DNA Sequence Viewer
This is a small project that allows you to add DNA strands to a table then view the base pairs of the DNA in colored syntax. 

### Features:
  - View Table of Sequences with date added to the table
  - Sort by any field by clicking on its table header
  - Zoom in on the a sequence by clicking the Zoom icon on the left of the row.
  - Narrow down the rows by searching in the input field on the top left of the table.
  - Add a sequence by clicking the Add + icon and filling out the form, prevents adding if sequence has invalid non DNA characters.
  
 ### Things to finish:
 - Correctly update the Sequence Table without a hard refresh.
 - Better error validation so that it displays the server error code in the UI, prevent adding until a response from the server happens.
 - Add abilty to batch upload sequences by either uploading a file or manually copying and pasting.
 - Add abilty to Query NCBI directly using the public API.
 - Clean up the styling, test all UI pieces along with Redux.
 - Find more scable way to display DNA syntax.
